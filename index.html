                <p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.
                And in spring too I feel no different.
                We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves
                through much dark-red loss, <span class="italic">appellation control√©e</span>,</p>
                <p>that deepens in the cellar of the years.
                We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.
                Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees
                sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.</p>
                <p>33, and in the midst of the dark wood
                of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,
                at home in the woods and desolate at home.</p>
                <p>Will we one day, maybe, ever?
                The summer is past, the hay-making is over.
                The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
